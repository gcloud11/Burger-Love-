# Eat-Da-Burger 
```
- Eat-Da-Burger! is a restaurant app that lets users input the names of burgers they'd like to eat. 
- Whenever a user submits a burger's name, this app will display the burger on the left side of the page -- waiting to be devoured.
- Each burger in the waiting area also has a Devour it! button. When the user clicks it, the burger will move to the right side of the page.
- Your app will store every burger in a database, whether devoured or not.
