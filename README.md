# Eat-Da-Burger 

  Eat-Da-Burger! is a fun gaming restaurant app that lets users input the names of burgers they'd like to eat. 
  Whenever a user submits a burger's name, this app will display the burger on the left side of the page -- waiting to be devoured.
  Each burger in the waiting area also has a Devour it! button. When the user clicks it, the burger will move to the right side of the   page. Your app will store every burger in a database, whether devoured or not.
